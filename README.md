# My Own Website [![Hugo Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Made%20with%20Hugo-ff4088?style=flat&logo=Hugo&logoColor=white&link=https://gohugo.io/)](https://gohugo.io/)

It all started with a will to learn front-end development. I thought: why not start it by creating my own website, even if it's a simple and static one? Here I am.

## Run Locally

After [installing hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) on your machine, run the command:

```bash
hugo server
```

and then visit `http://localhost:1313` on your browser.
